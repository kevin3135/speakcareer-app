# Agent Learning Log

## 2026-06-25

Built the initial SpeakCareer Expo TypeScript foundation.

What changed:

- Created a simple English MVP app structure.
- Added onboarding, home, practice, roleplay, progress and profile screens.
- Added local mock roleplays, AI feedback and progress mistake-bank data.
- Added product docs, eval docs, `.env.example`, README and development plan.

Assumptions:

- English-only is the correct first build.
- Mock AI feedback is enough for the first product foundation.
- A custom lightweight navigator is acceptable before the app needs deep linking or complex stacks.

Checks to run:

- `npm run typecheck`
- `npm run test`
- `npm run lint`

Next suggested task:

- Add a typed answer box to Roleplay and save a local mock session.
